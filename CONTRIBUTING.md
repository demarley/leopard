# Contribution Guide

We follow the [Feature Branch Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow)

To contribute to this project, please report **Issues** (to help with documentation & keeping track of changes).

In the "Issue", please include one of the following:
 1. ERROR
    - Full error message and environment setup (which tag/release, which files you were running over, what is the configuration, what were you trying to do, etc.)
    - Ideas on how to fix the problem or where the error is (ideally you tried something to fix the issue before reporting it)
    - Create a new branch (named after the error message) and submit a PR.  
      * If you know how to fix the issue, please perform this fix in the branch and comment this as well
 2. FEATURE REQUEST
    - Describe what limitations CyMiniAnaVLQ0L has that you want to address
    - Create a new branch (named after your feature) where work can begin to implement this feature
      * If you know how to implement this, please do this in the branch
      * If you do not know how to implement this, please try to add some pseudo-code or links that might outline what you want to do
 3. MISC.
    - If there is something else that you want to do, please create the issue or submit the PR to start a discussion.

For all options, please add 3 labels: a "STATUS", "TYPE", and "PRIORITY" label.  

The most helpful contributions will include attempts at a fix or implemntation of the feature and comments adequately describing what the user wants/needs.
